# organism-world-sim
The goal of this project was to implement a 2D virtual world simulator. The simulator consists of a two-dimensional grid where various organisms, including plants and animals, exist and interact with each other. The project aimed to simulate their behaviors, movements, and collisions in a turn-based manner.
OOP hierarchy: Organism → Animal/Plant → Species

Turn order by initiative and age

Species rules: movement, reproduction, collisions, abilities

Human special ability with cooldown

Save/Load game state; simple Tkinter UI
